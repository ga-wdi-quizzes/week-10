# Week 10

## Mongoose

### Question #1

Describe the differences between a SQL and NoSQL DB, and when you might use each.

```text
SQL databases are primarily relational, table-based databases, whereas NoSQL databases are non-relational and primarily use key value pairs and groups. SQL databases have predefined schema for their relationships (as in rails), whereas NoSQL do not have separate pre-defined schema files.    
```

### Question #2

What's wrong with this mongoose code and how might we fix it?
(Hint: Assuming there is a document with a name of "Bob", why is results not an author model on the second line?)

```js
var results = AuthorModel.find({name: "Bob"});
console.log(results);
```

```js
// The code does not use the callback function required in the Mongoose DB. You could call it using function(results) as the second attribute to the find function.

### Question #3

Convert the following ActiveRecord sequence to Mongoose:

```rb
@andy = Instructor.find_by(name: "Andy")
@andy.wishlist_items.create(description: "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold")
```

```js
Instructor.findOne({name: "Andy"}, function(err, andy){
  andy.wishlist_items.push({description: "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold");
  andy.save();
};
});
```

### Question #4

Convert the following create method in Mongoose to ActiveRecord.

```js
  var authors = {
  create: function(req, res){
  var author = new AuthorModel({name: req.body.name})
  author.save(function(err){
    if (!err){
      res.redirect("authors")
    }
  })
  }  
}
```

```@author = Author.create!(name: params[:name])

```
## Express

### Question #5

How does module.exports help us with separation of concerns?

```module.exports is the thing (sometimes an object) that is returned as the result of a require call.



```

### Question #6

Write one Express route for each of the four HTTP methods.

Then, make each route respond with a one-word string containing the RESTful action that would most likely be associated with this route.

```js
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

//
1 app.get("/", function(req, res){
res.send("INDEX");
});

2  app.put("/:id", function(req, res){
  res.send("UPDATE");
});

3  app.post("/", function(req, res){
  res.send("CREATE");
});

4  app.delete("/:id", function(req, res){
  res.send("DELETE");
});..

```

```js
// Your answer...
```
### Question #7

Describe the differences between Express and Rails as backend frameworks.

```Express is a framework that leaves a lot of the specifics and decisions about the structure to the user/developer, whereas Rails is specific and much be structured a certain way in order for the framework to function.

```

### Question #8

What is the importance of using body-parser in our express application for post requests?

```We use body-parser in express and node applications to take the data from users and make post requests.

```
